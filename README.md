# Senior-Design-Simulation-Code

Author: Iain Bisset

This repository contains the simulation code for my Senior Design project performed under the advisement of Professor Kyle Leach and in collaboration with a research group at Université de Montréal.

Each simulation is given in the form of a source file directory, and a build directory. To run the simulations, these directories must be placed alongside the installation directory for an instance of Geant4. 

The primary simulations conducted consist of preliminary Geant4 simulations, detailed detector construction via importation of CAD models, coincidence simulations, and electron backscattering simulations. More information is contained in the respective directories and code comments.
